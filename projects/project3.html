        <span>- Just like the typical captain of a ship,
	   he's the one that charges in their direction and has a responsibility for his crew or his ship.
           And just like my life, I am in charge of it.
           Any result I get, I'm responsible for it. And also the unfinished drawing,
           indicating that there is so much room for improvement in my life or in the direction where our ship is heading.</span></p>
