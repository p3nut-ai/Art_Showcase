          The product I designed is named Zion.
          It is basically an automated doorknob with an RFID card.
          It can solve the issue of security. Other people can't afford this type of product due to its expense.
          My design can drop the price by 80% compared to the other products. By doing it, many people can now afford this product to improve their security.</span>
