          <br> Nf is a rap artist I like his work because it doesn't align with the current rappers we have today.
          Rappers nowadays talks  about money, sex, and power. But NF focuses on the topics that are rarely talked about, like growing up without parents, anxiety and depression,
          and being with many people yet feeling lonely.
          Nf is the voice of the people who are facing that kind of problem.</span>
